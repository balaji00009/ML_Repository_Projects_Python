# Project Descriptions

## Exploratory Data Analysis on YouTube Data using Pandas [link](https://github.com/balaji00009/Python_Projects_-EDA-Regression-Visualizations/blob/main/You_tube_Data_Set_EDA_analysis.ipynb).

In this project, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization on YouTube data using Python. The analysis encompasses a comprehensive examination of data extracted from YouTube videos, including trend analysis, audience feedback, and engagement statistics. Leveraging Python's powerful libraries such as [NumPy](link_to_numpy), [Pandas](link_to_pandas), and [Matplotlib](link_to_matplotlib), I proficiently manipulated and visualized the data, generating interactive reports and insightful visualizations. This project serves as a testament to my expertise in data analysis, Python programming, data visualization, and the extraction of valuable insights from extensive datasets.

## Google Play Store Apps Analysis [link](https://github.com/balaji00009/Python_Projects_-EDA-Regression-Visualizations/blob/main/Google_Play_Store_EDA_Analysis.ipynb).

This project involves the exploration of Google Play Store apps, focusing on classification problems. Utilizing Jupyter Notebooks, I applied machine learning techniques to classify and analyze various aspects of mobile applications available on the Google Play Store. The project showcases my skills in data science and classification problem-solving.

## Honey Production Analysis [link](https://github.com/balaji00009/Python_Projects_-EDA-Regression-Visualizations/blob/main/Honey_production_Project_with_EDA_analysis%20.ipynb).

In another project, I delved into the analysis of honey production data. Leveraging Jupyter Notebooks, I applied classification techniques to gain insights into honey production trends. This project highlights my proficiency in handling classification problems and extracting meaningful information from diverse datasets.

## Sonar Classification Project [link](https://github.com/balaji00009/Python_Projects_-EDA-Regression-Visualizations/blob/main/ROCK%20AND%20MINE%20PREDICTOR%20classification%20problem%20using%20Logistic%20Regresion.ipynb)
The goal of this project is to develop a classification model using Logistic Regression to distinguish between submarine sonar signals representing "Rocks" and "Mines."Utilizing Logistic Regression, a robust binary classification technique, this project focuses on analyzing sonar signals. The model is trained on a dataset containing features extracted from these signals, aiming to accurately classify whether the signal corresponds to a rock or a mine.

## Diabetic Prediction in Pregnant Women using SVM [link](https://github.com/balaji00009/Python_Projects_-EDA-Regression-Visualizations/blob/main/SVM%20Diabetic_prediction%20of%20Women.ipynb)
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to identify the likelihood of diabetes in pregnant women based on relevant health features.Pregnant women with diabetes face increased health risks, making early detection crucial for effective management. This project leverages SVM, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to analyze health-related data and predict whether a pregnant woman is at risk of developing diabetes.The dataset used in this project includes comprehensive health information about pregnant women, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and historical diabetes status. This diverse dataset allows the SVM model to learn patterns and make predictions based on multiple features.

## Palestine -- Isarael War conflict [link](https://github.com/balaji00009/Python_Projects_-EDA-Regression-Visualizations/blob/main/palestine.ipynb)
This is the csv Data set for fatalities count by region, type of ammuntion, citizenship whether they took part in Hostilites and many other factors. Loaded in Jupyter notebook, using pandas library, Exploratory data analysis done, cleaned & Imputed null values, also done visualizations using seaborn & Matplot library and finally utilized this cleaned data set for power bi visualizations.
