Exploratory Data Analysis on YouTube Data using Pandas (Python):
Utilizing Python, I conducted exploratory data analysis and visualization of data extracted from YouTube videos, including trend analysis, audience feedback, and engagement statistics. I leveraged Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization, generating interactive reports and visualizations. Demonstrating expertise in data analysis, Python programming, data visualization, and extraction of valuable insights from extensive datasets.

In addition, I have also completed projects on GooglePlayStore apps and Honeyproduction, Classification problems utilizing Jupiter notebook. For further insight, you may refer to my GitHub repository.
