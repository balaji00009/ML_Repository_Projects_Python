# Project Descriptions

## Exploratory Data Analysis on YouTube Data using Pandas (Python)

In this project, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization on YouTube data using Python. The analysis encompasses a comprehensive examination of data extracted from YouTube videos, including trend analysis, audience feedback, and engagement statistics. Leveraging Python's powerful libraries such as [NumPy](link_to_numpy), [Pandas](link_to_pandas), and [Matplotlib](link_to_matplotlib), I proficiently manipulated and visualized the data, generating interactive reports and insightful visualizations. This project serves as a testament to my expertise in data analysis, Python programming, data visualization, and the extraction of valuable insights from extensive datasets.

## Google Play Store Apps Analysis [https://github.com/balaji00009/Python_Projects_-EDA-Regression-Visualizations/blob/main/Google_Play_Store_EDA_Analysis.ipynb]

This project involves the exploration of Google Play Store apps, focusing on classification problems. Utilizing Jupyter Notebooks, I applied machine learning techniques to classify and analyze various aspects of mobile applications available on the Google Play Store. The project showcases my skills in data science and classification problem-solving.

## Honey Production Analysis

In another project, I delved into the analysis of honey production data. Leveraging Jupyter Notebooks, I applied classification techniques to gain insights into honey production trends. This project highlights my proficiency in handling classification problems and extracting meaningful information from diverse datasets.
